Web Application for Lawrence Hall of Science Learning Design Department

Incubator is an educational web application that let the users test how different combinations of the Phase Change Materials (PCMs) inside of an incubator can change the temperature of the baby inside of it. Users have three different materials to choose from and they can also choose the material for insulating layer from two choices. They can drag and drop the materials to place them in the pouches of the incubator. Users can also click the material to read more information about the material (freezing point, reheat time, etc) and then make their decisions. After click test button, they can see the results summary and a graph showing the how temperature changes over time.
